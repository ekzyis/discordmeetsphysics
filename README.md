# physicsbot

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

A Discord bot for usage in a physics discord server of my university hence the repository name

Written in Node.js with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)

Current features:
- greets a new member
- can set user roles via message reactions
- scrapes from websites to keep embeds up to date

*P.S.: Not designed for public usage since the scraping part is tailored for specific websites but the source code may help some people?*
